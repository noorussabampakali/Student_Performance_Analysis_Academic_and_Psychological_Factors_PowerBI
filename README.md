🎓 Comprehensive_Analysis_of_Student_Performance_Through_Academic_and_Psychological_Factors_Using_PowerBI

📊 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize student performance through both academic metrics and psychological factors. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how mental health, stress levels, study habits, and socio-behavioral traits influence academic success.

Education is more than grades — this project aims to provide a data-driven lens into student wellbeing and performance trends.
